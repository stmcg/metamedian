Description: Implements several methods to meta-analyze studies that report the 
    sample median of the outcome. When the primary studies are one-group 
    studies, the methods of McGrath et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8013> can 
    be applied to estimate the pooled median. In the two-group context, the 
    methods of McGrath et al. (2018) <arXiv:1809.01278> can be applied to 
    estimate the pooled raw difference of medians across groups.
